Snake Game 
I am a Python programmer who is passionate about coding and always looking to improve my skills. 
On my GitHub, you will find a collection of projects that I have worked on to showcase my abilities. 
One of these projects is a small Snake game that I developed using Python,
which allowed me to practice my coding skills and implement various features such as user input,
collision detection, and game logic. Check out my code and feel free to reach out to me with any feedback or questions.
